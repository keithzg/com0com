# com0com
Fork of com0com from http://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/

Features Visual Studio 2015 projects for all the various components due to Raggles' work. Intending on testing reasonably extensively and signing a release with a company cert from my employer, for the sake of our company product (which on some systems relies on the user being able to set up virtual serial ports, and our old solution won't work on 64-bit Windows at all).

Selected patches and minor modifications have been applied from the original source - trawl the commit history for details.

###Installer

Haven't tried using or building it, but everything is pretty much portable anyway.
